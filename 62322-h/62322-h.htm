<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_3" id="page_3">{3}</a></span>way, and only because we are looked after, it is called eye service:
but when we do so willingly and from a motive to please, it is then
termed a service of love and affection.</p>

<p>I will tell you a story about the two sorts of service, and then you
shall say which it is you ought to practise.</p>

<p>Two little girls, who had been carefully brought up by wise but poor
parents, were one day left, in the time of harvest, to take care of a
cottage, and to tend their little baby brother, who slept in the cradle.
The mother was gone out to glean. She gave them their food and set them
their tasks for the day, and carrying her own and her husband’s dinner
in a basin, she bade them good-bye. The children were pleased with the
new idea of being mistresses of the little cottage for so many hours.
And as they were really good girls, it never entered their heads to do
in their mother’s absence what they would have feared to do in her
presence. Meggie therefore cleaned the door-step, as she had been told,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_4" id="page_4">{4}</a></span>and washed some socks for the baby; and Bessie, who was older and</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 361px;">

<p class="nind">stronger, carried out the basket of butter to several houses which
their mother supplied. At noon they sat down to dinner. They were rather
tempted to give little Dick, the baby, the things he cried for, in order
to keep him quiet; but the words, “eye service,” came into their minds
several times, and they resisted the temptation. After dinner was over,
the children cleared away and went into the garden to play. They were
very merry at bo-peep with baby, when a girl, called Jenny Bryant,
popped her head over the hedge and said, “We have had fine sport to-day,
come to our house, and we will show you what it is.” Now Jenny, although
a near neighbour, was a girl with whom their mother did not like her
little daughters to be intimate, for although a good-tempered child, she
was not well brought up, and cared very little for her father and
mother.</p>

<p>On this day, her mother, as well as Bessie’s and Meggie’s, was out
gleaning, and Jenny, and a few companions as idle as herself, had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_6" id="page_6">{6}</a></span>gossipping with a gipsy woman, asking her to tell fortunes, as it is
called; a thing which some people know to be silly, but which it is
better to call by its true name, wicked. Now Jenny’s orders had been to
let no one into the house, for Mrs. Bryant had many beautiful lace
sleeves, and collars, and handkerchiefs, belonging to the gentlefolks of
the village, lying on her dresser waiting to be ironed. But poor Jenny,
no sooner was her mother’s eye taken from her than she invited several
of the neighbouring girls to come in and chat with her; and these girls,
as thoughtless as herself, had tempted her to ask the gipsy in. And now
Jenny wanted Bessie and Meggie to come too, and tried all possible ways
to tempt them to leave the cottage. “So near to our house,” said Jenny,
“and so easy to lock the door. Oh, come along? It is such fun to hear
the old woman’s stories.” But they refused. “If we go with you, Jenny,”
said Meggie, “we should be disobeying mother.” “Did your mother tell
you,” said Jenny, “not to leave the house?” “No,” replied Bessie, “but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_7" id="page_7">{7}</a></span>we know that she would not like our doing so; she never likes the house
to be left.” “Well, you are <i>over</i> good,” said Jenny, with a jeering
laugh; “I think it is enough if I do what mother tells me, without
guessing at her wishes when she is out of it. Then, let us bring the
gipsy in to you.”</p>

<p>“No! that would be as bad,” exclaimed both the children. “I am sure,”
said the elder, “mother would dislike our talking to the gipsy.”
“Nonsense!” said Jenny, as, laughing and mocking at the good little
girls, she ran away across the green. She had scarcely got half way
there, however, before two girls came running to meet her, saying that
the gipsy would not wait, and that they had sent Fanny Mitchell, the
third girl, home to get some money of her sister, to pay the gipsy&mdash;for
gipsies will not tell fortunes for nothing.</p>

<p>But what was Jenny’s surprise when she came into the house to find the
gipsy gone! and what was her mother’s anger when she returned at night,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_8" id="page_8">{8}</a></span>to find half-a-dozen handkerchiefs, some new lace, and fine-worked
collars, gone too! How this came about Jenny knew well, and at length
confessed.</p>

<p>The little girls who had acted, in their mother’s absence, out of
heart-love to her, just the same as if she had been present, could bid
her welcome with a joyful kiss that evening, and the mother, as she
knelt down with them before they went to rest, and prayed to the great
God to keep and preserve them, thanked Him that He had given to her
children who served her with love and not with eye service.</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
